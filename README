summon.js is a javascript library that provides rapid prototyping of
2D visualizations. summon.js gives the user an "infinite white board"
on which to draw.  The user can then scroll and zoom through the
drawing similar to Google Maps.  This very simple form of interaction
actually covers a surprisingly wide variety of visualizations commonly
encountered in scientific settings.  For example, this user interface
works well for many visualizations in computational biology, such as
phylogenetic trees, hierarchical clustering trees, sequence
alignments, large heatmaps, and tracks within genome browsers.

Another subtle feature is that zooming can also be done independently
along horizontal and vertical axes.  Therefore, the user can plot in
the coordinate system most comfortable for the context.  This reduces
effort in planning out pixel real estate.  In addition, text labels
are also designed to resize themselves automatically based on the current 
view or even clip if the text is not sufficiently large.
